***************Unlocking Jenkins & Joing Agent as jenkins*******************

for accessing  a new Jenkins instance, to unlock it using an automatically-generated password.

Browse to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port configured for Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.

Unlock Jenkins page

From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of asterisks).

Copying the initial admin password
Note:

The command: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword will print the password at the console.


On the Unlock Jenkins page, paste this password into the Administrator password field and click Continue.
Note:

The Jenkins console log indicates the location (in the Jenkins home directory) where this password can also be obtained. This password must be entered in the setup wizard on new Jenkins installations before you can access Jenkins’s main UI. This password also serves as the default administrator account’s password (with username "admin") if you happen to skip the subsequent user-creation step in the setup wizard.

Customizing Jenkins with plugins
After unlocking Jenkins, the Customize Jenkins page appears. can install any number of useful plugins as part of your initial setup.

Click one of the two options shown:

Install suggested plugins - to install the recommended set of plugins, which are based on most common use cases.

Select plugins to install - to choose which set of plugins to initially install. When you first access the plugin selection page, the suggested plugins are selected by default.

If you are not sure what plugins you need, choose Install suggested plugins. You can install (or remove) additional Jenkins plugins at a later point in time via the Manage Jenkins > Plugins page in Jenkins.
The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and your chosen set of Jenkins plugins being installed. This process may take a few minutes.

Creating the first administrator user
Finally, after customizing Jenkins with plugins, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

When the Create First Admin User page appears, specify the details for your administrator user in the respective fields and click Save and Finish.

When the Jenkins is ready page appears, click Start using Jenkins.
Notes:

This page may indicate Jenkins is almost ready! instead and if so, click Restart.

If the page does not automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser to refresh the page manually.

If required, login to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just created and you are ready to start using Jenkins!
